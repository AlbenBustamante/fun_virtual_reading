It's a RESTful API for a virtual library.

### How does it work?
The first thing is to register users, for this it is necessary to first register their nationality and assign it.

Then create a new genre as the books are organized by category.

Finally, create a new book and assign it its genre and the user who publishes it.

With that it is done.

Additionally, users can 'Like' books and they are stored in a list. They can delete it whenever they want.

Also, they can create collections to organize the books at their convenience, this is where they can give the book a score and a short note to identify it more easily.

Users can also comment on books.

### How can I use the application?

### How did I do it?
I developed it from the Spring Boot Frameworks, Spring Data and Spring Security (basic security).

Also, I used some libraries like Validation for data validation, Mapstruct to map entities to data transfer objects, and Lombok.

The graphic environment is thanks to Swagger.
